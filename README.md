## Module 14 Challenge

For this challenge, I was tasked with filtering data and making an interactive dashboard on a webpage. I had an html file, a data file and a json file. With the html file, I had bootstrap, plotly, and Domm libraries so I could work with them in the json file. In the json file, I read in the data from the data file, but I started with just the names. Then I filtered the names to the ID. I was able to append the names to the dropdown menu. This way the dashboard was interactive and I could change IDs to get new information. 

Next, I could the data for metadata and the sample. I filtered the metadata and split it into keys, and values. I wanted the keys and values to be the demographic information.  I was able to append it to the dashboard and give it a size. This way went the dropdown menu was changed, the demographic information changed with it. 

For the graphs, I used the sample data. I used plotly to make a layout for the bar graph with x and y and then split and reversed the order. The y-axis was still all numbers. I converted it to a string, so the y-axis looked better. With the bubble chart, the layout was a little more complicated, but easier to figure it. I added in the values and plotted both graphs onto the dashboard.
